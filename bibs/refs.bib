Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed pliable data shuffling is able to significantly reduce the communication bandwidth while achieving desirable learning performance.},

    ABSTRACT = {The index coding problem consists of a system with a server and multiple receivers with different side information and demand sets, connected by a noiseless broadcast channel. The server knows the side information available to the receivers. The objective is to design an encoding scheme that enables all receivers to decode their demanded messages with a minimum number of transmissions, referred to as an index code length. The problem of finding the minimum length index code that enables all receivers to correct a specific number of errors has also been studied. This work establishes a connection between index coding and error-correcting codes with multiple interpretations from the tree construction of nested cyclic codes. The notion of multiple interpretations using nested codes is as follows: different data packets are independently encoded, and then combined by addition and transmitted as a single codeword, minimizing the number of channel uses and offering error protection. The resulting packet can be decoded and interpreted in different ways, increasing the error correction capability, depending on the amount of side information available at each receiver. Motivating applications are network downlink transmissions, information retrieval from datacenters, cache management, and sensor networks.},

We formulate this as a new problem in the context of index coding: we relax the index coding requirements to capture scenarios where each client has preferences associated with messages. The client is satisfied to receive any message she does not already have, with a satisfaction proportional to her preference for that message. We consistently find, over a number of scenarios we sample, that although the optimization problems are in general NP-hard, significant bandwidth savings are possible even when restricted to polynomial time algorithms.},

    abstract = {Pliable index coding (PICOD) has recently been regarded as a promising solution that exploits the coding advantage to improve communication efficiency of content-type systems (e.g., recommendation system), where clients are pliable and are interested in receiving any new message that they do not have. PICOD aims to find an effective coding strategy that satisfies the demands of all clients with the minimum number of transmissions. However, most of the previous works mainly provided theoretical understanding on PICOD in special instances based on greedy algorithms. In contrast, in this paper, we present a flexible sparse and low-rank matrix modeling approach to minimize the number of transmissions for the general PICOD problems. This is achieved by establishing generalized pliable alignment conditions to guarantee the requirements of all clients. As the resulting non-convex problem is highly intractable, we further develop an alternating pursuit framework to detect the rank of the matrix to be recovered by using the rank-increasing strategy. To address the feasibility-detection issues in the existing methods, we propose an alternating projection algorithm, which admits closed-form expressions and avoids excessive sparsity inducing. Moreover, we establish the global convergence of the alternating projection algorithm with random initial points. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed alternating pursuit algorithm significantly reduces the number of transmissions compared to the state-of-the-art methods.},

    abstract = {Pliable Index CODing (PICOD) is a variant of the Index Coding (IC) problem in which a user is satisfied whenever it can successfully decode any one message that is not in its side information set, as opposed to a fixed pre-determined message. has n = Σ The complete-S PICOD with m messages, for S ⊆ [0 : m - 1], has n = Σs∈S (sm) users with distinct side information sets. Past work on PICOD provided tight converse results when either the sender is constrained to use linear codes, or for some special classes of complete-S PICOD. This paper provides a tight information theoretic converse result (i.e., no restriction to linear codes) for the so-called “consecutive complete-S” PICOD, where the set S satisfies S = [smin : smax] for some 0 ≤ smin ≤ smax ≤ m - 1. This result extends existing converse results and shows that linear codes have the smallest possible code lenght given by min (m - smin, 1 + smax). The central contribution is a novel proof technique rooted in combinatorics. The main idea is to consider all the messages a user can eventually successfully decode, in addition to its own desired message. This allows us to circumvent the necessity of essentially considering all possible assignments of desired messages for the users. The keystone of the proof is to show that, for the case of S = {s} and m = 2s + 1, there exists at least one user who can decode s + 1 messages. From this, the extension to the “consecutive complete-S” PICOD follows.},

Given the difficulty of the general version of this problem, this paper focuses on the case where the side information sets are `s circular shifts', namely, user u's side information set is the set of messages indexed by {u, u +1,...,u + s - 1} for some fixed s and where the indices are intended modulo the cardinality of the message set. This particular setting has been studied in the `decentralized non-secure' and in the `centralized secure' settings, thus allows one to quantify the cost of decentralized communication under security constraints on the number of transmissions. Interestingly, the decentralized vs the centralized secure setting incurs a multiplicative gap of approximately three. This is in contrast to the cases without security constraint, where the multiplicative gap is known to be at most two.},

    abstract = {The problem of deciding whether a given propositional formula in conjunctive normal form is satisfiable has been widely studied. I t is known that, when restricted to formulas having only two literals per clause, this problem has an efficient (polynomial-time) solution. But the same problem on formulas having three literals per clause is NP-complete, and hence probably does not have any efficient solution.In this paper, we consider an infinite class of satisfiability problems which contains these two particular problems as special cases, and show that every member of this class is either polynomial-time decidable or NP-complete. The infinite collection of new NP-complete problems so obtained may prove very useful in finding other new NP-complete problems. The classification of the polynomial-time decidable cases yields new problems that are complete in polynomial time and in nondeterministic log space.We also consider an analogous class of problems, involving quantified formulas, which has the property that every member is either polynomial time decidable or complete in polynomial space.},
