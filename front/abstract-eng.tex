Index coding problem (ICOD), introduced in \cite{4031356}, is a canonical problem in the field of communication theory. It is connected to many problems in the theory of communication and combinatorics. A relaxed version of ICOD, called pliable index coding(PICOD) is introduced in \cite{pliablefirstpaper}. 
In this work, we introduce the source code counterpart of PICOD which we call it ``pliable source index coding problem (PSCI)'' problem. We use linear algebraic tools and techniques to show that for the case of linear PIC and linear PSICOD problems, there exists a strong linear algebraic duality.
